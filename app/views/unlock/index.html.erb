    <p>Hello and welcome to BlindPages - Accessibility Without the Wait!</p>
    <p>We think it's a <em>crying shame</em> that blind and partially sighted people have to wait for some company or other to make their favourite content usable. You may already know that only a small percentage of sites make their pages and videos and other content accessible, so you could be waiting a <em>long</em> time! So we set out to make <em>anything</em> accessible, <em>when you want it</em>, without the wait!</p>
    <p>Don't believe us? Try it out using the form below. Describe what you want to use - a web site, a youTube video, a BBC TV programme, or something else. We'll get cracking on making it accessible for you and ask you to tell us what you think of the result. Since you're helping us improve our service, of course we wouldn't think of charging - your request is totally <em>free</em>.</p>

    <% form_tag('/thanks', :method => :get) do %>
      <p>
        <label for="video"><strong>Video</strong></label> (Is there a video you'd like to have audio described, maybe on youTube, a BBC channel, or somewhere else? If so, tell us where to find it.)<br/>
        <%= text_field_tag :video %><br/>
        <label for="site"><strong>Web site</strong></label> (Is there a web site you have trouble using? If so, tell us how to find it.)<br/>
        <%= text_field_tag :site %><br/>
        <label for="other"><strong>Anything else</strong></label> (We've only listed two things. Tell us what else we can make accessible for you and we'll give it our best shot!)<br/>
        <%= text_field_tag :other %><br/>
        <label for="contact"><strong>Contact info:</strong></label> (How do we get in touch with you? Email, phone, carrier pigeon?)<br/>
        <%= text_field_tag :contact %><br/>
        <%= submit_tag "Send" %>        
      </p>
    <% end %>
